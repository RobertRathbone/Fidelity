# FidelityMy CRUD site for fidelity is a blog demonstration.

It starts with three labeled windows, Title, Body, Description. You type in the windows and hit the Submit button, then the title and description of 
the blog will appear at the top, along with three buttons: Delete, Body and Update. Clicking on Body will take you to the body of the blog. 
Update will take you to a form with the blog on it for reference, which you can then change. And delete is self explanatory.
